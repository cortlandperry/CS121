You can put your answers for Problem 1.2 in this file.
------------------------------------------------------
Primary Keys are Specified by _primarykey_ in the schema, like was allowed in HW5.

audio_files(_audio_id_, path, filename, length)
* path is a Candidate Key

song(_audio_id_, intro_length, is_explicit)
* audio_id is a foreign key to audio_files.audio_id

tag(_audio_id_, _tag_val_)
* audio_id is a foreign key to song.audio_id

Since each ad has a company, we can combine the ad and ad_company schemas like so:

ads(_audio_id_, ad_start, ad_end, price, company_id)
* audio_id is a foreign key to audio_files.audio_id
* company_id is a foreign key to company.company_id
* A NOT NULL constraint must be placed on company_id for total participation 

promos(_audio_id_, promo_type, promo_url)
* audio_id is a foreign key to audio_files.audio_id

Since every start_time, end_time has something played on the playlist, we can
combine the playlist and master_playlist schemas:

playlist(_start_time_, end_time, is_request, audio_id)
* audio_id is a foreign key to audio_files.audio_id
* a NOT NULL constraint must be placed on audio_id for total participation

artist(_artist_id_, artist_name)

company(_company_id_, company_name)

contact_emails(_company_id_, _contact_email_)
* company_id is a foreign key to company.company_id

song_artists(_artist_id_, _audio_id_)
* audio_id is a foreign key to song.audio_id
* artist_id is a foreign key to artist
* a NOT NULL constraint must be placed on artist_id to enforce total participation
